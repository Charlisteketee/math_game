# MATH GAME

## Super Fun 2 player Math game! Get smorter ðŸ¥¸

This is an OOP-based command-line application with Ruby.

Players take turns answering a simple math addition problem. If you get it wrong, you lose a life. But don't worry, both players start with 3 lives!

At the end of every turn, the game will output the new score for both players.

## Usage

Once you have cloned the repo, go into the root folder and run ruby main.rb. 

Then follow the prompts and have fun! 

## Acknowledgments!

I would like to acknowledge my son Noah for learning how to count.
